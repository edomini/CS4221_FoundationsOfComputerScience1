# CS4221 Foundations of Computer Science
For your final project you will need to write some Racket code that uses conditionals and/or recursion that can be mapped onto a list.
### Specifically, for the project you will need to produce the following:
- A clear statement of what the problem is;
- Sample data to test your function(s) on. If this data contains malformed input that your function can work around, you will get higher credit (see, for example, the material where we used filter identity);
- Well-documented  functions that you'll use;
- A main function which will be mapped onto the data. You should utilise a conditional statement; however, this function should implement recursion to earn full credit. 
- Clear instructions on how to execute your code;
- Details on how you used ChatGPT (or some other LLM) in your project. This can include code generation (use sparsely, if at all!), testing, brain-storming, etc.;
